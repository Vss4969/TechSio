# SSL-Project
Social media


# Authentication Page
We will use authentication page for Signin/Signout type of things. Basically it is a login page. (Will contain userName(userId),Name, email, password) {It's a basic demand, if anyone
have another idea please append it in query}.


# Profile page
Profile page will show info about user

# Chat Page 
We'll use this page to render messages (If possible we'll try to render it like any social media, if not will use any simple way to design it).

# Edit Account 
 Edit Account enable us to change userInfo.{Here we'll also ask user to upload his/her pic && currently we'll not ask to change userName}
 
# Media page 
We'll work on media page bit later, if we would be able to make efficient backend for this.
